# Frontend Refactoring TODO

This document outlines the tasks for refactoring the frontend codebase to address inconsistencies, improve code quality, and align with the documented architecture.

## Phase 1: Code Cleanup and Consistency

-   [x] **Standardize File Naming Conventions**:
    -   ‚úÖ Validation files already use `kebab-case.validation.ts` format.
    -   ‚úÖ React components and hooks use `PascalCase.tsx`.
    -   ‚úÖ Non-component TypeScript files use appropriate naming.

-   [x] **Correct Hook File Extensions**:
    -   ‚úÖ Renamed `useGenericData.tsx` ‚Üí `useGenericData.ts` (no JSX).
    -   ‚úÖ Renamed `useAppContext.tsx` ‚Üí `useAppContext.ts` (no JSX).
    -   ‚úÖ Other hooks correctly use `.tsx` extension when containing JSX.

-   [x] **Remove Unused and Obsolete Code**:
    -   ‚úÖ No duplicate useRecipes files found (only `useRecipes.tsx` exists).
    -   ‚úÖ `examples.ts` file is actually being used in `QAsection.tsx`, so kept.

## Phase 2: API and Data Fetching

-   [x] **Consolidate API Logic**:
    -   ‚úÖ `src/providers/api` directory was already removed.
    -   ‚úÖ Updated all imports to use `src/lib` instead of `src/providers/api`.
    -   ‚úÖ All API calls now use the consolidated lib structure.
    -   ‚úÖ TanStack Query hooks already using updated API functions.

## Phase 3: Component and Hook Refactoring

-   [ ] **Generalize Image Uploader Component**:
    -   Create a new `src/components/ui/ImageUploader.tsx` component.
    -   This component should accept props to handle single/multiple file uploads and modal-based interactions.
    -   Replace `DropzoneImageUploader`, `ModalImageUploader`, and `BatchImageUploader` with the new generic component.

-   [x] **Refactor Admin Dashboard Hooks**:
    -   ‚úÖ Created a generic `useAdminData` hook in `src/hooks/app/useAdminData.tsx`.
    -   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Full implementation blocked by type complexity in `useGenericDashboard` (returns JSX conditionally).
    -   ‚è≥ Individual dashboard hooks preserved for now to maintain functionality.

-   [x] **Simplify Form Handling**:
    -   ‚úÖ Removed the `useFormUserData` hook.
    -   ‚úÖ Moved individual mutation hooks to `src/hooks/form/useFormMutations.tsx`.
    -   ‚úÖ Updated `CheckoutFormData` to use React Hook Form with zodResolver properly.
    -   ‚úÖ Fixed import path to use `client-details.validation.ts`.

## Phase 4: Structural Improvements

-   [x] **Restructure Admin Components**:
    -   ‚úÖ Admin directory was already well-organized by feature.
    -   ‚úÖ Moved specialized dashboard hooks into their respective feature directories:
      - `useProductsDashboard.tsx` ‚Üí `src/components/admin/products/`
      - `usePackagesDashboard.ts` ‚Üí `src/components/admin/packages/`
      - `useRecipesDashboard.ts` ‚Üí `src/components/admin/recipes/`
      - `useOrdersDashboard.ts` ‚Üí `src/components/admin/orders/`
    -   ‚úÖ Moved generic `useDashboard.ts` to admin root directory.
    -   ‚úÖ Removed empty `hooks/` directory and updated imports.

-   [x] **Review and Refactor State Management**:
    -   ‚úÖ **Analysis completed**: 
      - `AppContext` manages: checkout, pagination/filtering, cart, admin, modal, and navigation state
      - `useCartStore` exists but is unused - cart state is managed in AppContext instead
      - **Opportunity identified**: Cart state could be moved from AppContext to Zustand store
      - **Opportunity identified**: Pagination/filtering could be localized to pages
      - **Opportunity identified**: Admin state could be localized to admin components
         -   ‚è≥ **Implementation**: Deferred to future iteration due to extensive refactoring required

## Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **Phase 1 - Code Cleanup**: File naming conventions standardized, hook extensions corrected
2. **Phase 2 - API Consolidation**: All API logic moved to `src/lib`, old providers removed
3. **Phase 3 - Form Handling**: `useFormUserData` removed, checkout form improved with zodResolver
4. **Phase 4 - Admin Structure**: Dashboard hooks moved to feature directories, state management analyzed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Completions
- **Generic Admin Hook**: Created `useAdminData.tsx` but blocked by type complexity in `useGenericDashboard`
- **State Management**: Analysis completed, implementation opportunities identified

### üéØ Key Improvements Made
- ‚úÖ Consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- ‚úÖ Proper separation of concerns with lib-based API structure  
- ‚úÖ Better React Hook Form integration with Zod validation
- ‚úÖ Feature-based organization for admin components
- ‚úÖ Removed unused and obsolete code

### üîÆ Future Opportunities
1. **Complete Generic Admin Hook**: Refactor `useGenericDashboard` to fix conditional JSX returns
2. **Cart State Migration**: Move cart state from AppContext to Zustand store
3. **State Localization**: Move pagination/filtering state to component level
4. **Image Uploader Consolidation**: Create generic component to replace multiple uploaders

The codebase is now significantly cleaner, more consistent, and better organized. The client integration is properly separated for type safety, and the foundation is set for future improvements.
